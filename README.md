# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Facebook's Prophet is a project that aims to predict the future stock prices of Google using historical stock data. The goal of the project is to develop models that can accurately predict future stock prices, which can be useful for investors and traders in making buy or sell decisions.


### A project to predict the stock price of Google using time series forecasting (TSF) techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and Facebook's Prophet would involve the following steps:

1.Collecting historical stock data: The first step would be to collect historical stock data for Google. This data would be used to train and test the TSF models.

2.Data pre-processing: The collected data would need to be pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers, and to make it suitable for training the TSF models.

3.Choosing a TSF model: The project would use LSTM and Facebook's Prophet model to predict the stock prices of Google.

4.Model training: The TSF models would be trained on the pre-processed data. The LSTM model would be trained on the time series data, while the Prophet model would use the historical stock data to build a model.

5.Model evaluation: The trained models would be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).

6.Fine-tuning and improving the models: Based on the evaluation results, the models would be fine-tuned and improved to achieve better performance.

7.Making predictions: Once the models are trained and fine-tuned, they can be used to make predictions on the stock prices of Google.
